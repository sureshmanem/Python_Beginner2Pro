       " \"School rankings\\n Over the years, the media and MBA\\n program brochures have elevated the significance of business \\nschool rankings as one of the most important benchmarks for choosing \\na school to attend. However, \\nschool rankings often depend on which publication you read and what research methodology was \\nuse\\nd. In some cases, information is subjective and may include results that are not checked for \\naccuracy. \\nMost importantly\\n, rankings do not take into account the unique elements of certain \\nprograms and how these attributes might meet your individual needs. \\nRankings tell you what \\nschools are ﬁbestﬂ but do not take into account ﬁbest fit.ﬂ\\n    Admissions testing\\n Most MBA programs require at least one graduate admissions test score. \\n  www.mba.com\\n Graduate Management Admissio\\nns Test (GMAT\\n®)  www.ets.org\\n Graduate Record\\n Exam\\ninations\\n (GRE)\\n Consult the individual school website for requirements.

Essay prompts may include \\na range of subjects such as \\nleadership, long\\n-term career goals, professional \\naccomplishments\\n, and \\ncommunity engagement\\n. When preparing your essays, \\nmake sure that together they tell one story\\n.  \\nYou, as the candidate\\n, are the story. Your essays should refle\\nct different aspects of your character, \\naccomplishments and aspirations that will allow the admissions committee to know you better. \\n   Write to express, not impress.\\n Admissions professionals can tell when you™re\\n just writ\\ning \\nwhat you think they want to \\nread\\n. If you™ve done your homework, you know why you want \\nan MBA degree and how that fits into your overall career game plan.\\n  What will you bring to the classroom?\\n Being part of a business school community is a \\ngive\\n-and\\n-take proposition. It™s not only about what you can gain from business school, it™s \\nalso about what you™re willing to share. Candidates are often judged by what value they can \\nbring to the classroom a\\nnd the community experience\\n, in addition to\\n how well they match \\nentrance requirements.\\n  Why this school?\\n Much like applying for a job, know why you want to pursue an MBA at a \\nparticular school or program. Show that you are familiar with the given school and\\n why you \\nare a good fit. \\n  Reality check: Is this the right time for you?\\n You™re going to business school to advance \\nyour career, right? Your job success as an MBA graduate may rely to a large extent on what \\nyou did beforehand. Find out what MBA employers l\\nook for in candidates by talking to \\nstudents, alumni and the school™s career \\nservices \\noffice. If you don't have enough experience \\nright now to benefit fully from an MBA, further define your goals and apply later.\\n  \",\n",
       " 'Letters of \\nrecommendation\\n  A recommendati\\non letter needs to\\n: 1. Support how well you can manage the academic demands of the MBA program and your \\npotential to succeed in your chosen career\\n. 2. Validate or expand on your credentials, strengths, and aspirations\\n. 3. Help\\n the admissions office to\\n get an overall \\nsense\\n of \\nyou as a\\n candidate\\n.  Choose a good cross\\n-sect\\nion of people who can attest to \\nyour dependability and who know about \\nyour plans for MBA study, such as \\nemployers, colleagues, and faculty\\n. Schools may have different \\nre\\ncommendation\\n requirement\\ns. Check with each school you are applying to before you select your \\nre\\ncommender\\ns. Each program requires a specific number of recommendation letters, usually two \\nor three. \\nDon™t exceed that number without prior agreement from the admissions staff\\n. Recommen\\ndations are valuable only if they reflect relevant professional skills. Avoid getting letters \\nfrom people with important\\n-sounding job titles who do not know you or your work.\\n   Resume\\n  There is not a special format for your resume when applying to business\\n school. Use the OCS \\nresume templates on the OCS website as your guideline. Make sure to emphasize your leadership \\nexperience as well as your analytical and quantitative aptitude.\\n  Interviews \\n Many schools conduct admissions interviews\\n and most offer advic\\ne about how to prepare on their \\nAdmissions website. Each program varies in format and location of the interview. Generally, an \\nadmissions interview provides an opportunity for you to review your accomplishments relative to \\nyour interest in the program.\\n  Financial \\naid You can find information about determining the ﬁreal costﬂ of your MBA as well as financial aid \\nresources at the official GMAT website at \\nwww.mba.com\\n.  In general, financial aid may be available \\nto you thr\\nough grants and scholarships, loans\\n, and Federal Work Study. In some cases, pre\\n-MBA \\nemployers may offer to re\\n-pay all or a portion of the cost of your program once you return to work \\nfor them.
